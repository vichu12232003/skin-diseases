# 🏥 Skin Disease Chatbot

This is a **multimodal chatbot** that predicts **skin diseases** using **text, images, and audio inputs**.  
It utilizes **Deep Learning (PyTorch)** for image classification and **Google Gemini AI** for text/audio-based diagnosis.

## **📌 Features**
✅ **Image Analysis** – Upload a skin image for disease prediction  
✅ **Text Diagnosis** – Describe symptoms in text for AI-based diagnosis  
✅ **Voice Input** – Record audio and get a disease prediction  
✅ **Streamlit Web Interface** – User-friendly chatbot UI

## **📌 Setup Instructions**
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have **Python 3.11+** installed.  
Run the following command to install all required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you face any issues with audio recording, manually install:
```bash
pip install streamlit-webrtc
```

### **2️⃣ Place Trained Models**
Download your trained model files (`.pth`) and place them inside:  
```
SkinDiseaseChatbot/
│── trained_models/
│   │── resnet50.pth
│   │── efficientnet_b3.pth
│   │── densenet121.pth
```
